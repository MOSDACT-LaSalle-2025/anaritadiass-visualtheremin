# anaritadiass-visualtheremin
This project is an exploration of the translation and mapping of pixels detected by a screen into the greyscale measures, and from this the intersection in between the lines in the screen leads us to growing it into shapes. Based on the Theremin instrument and methodology, the aim is sound with shapes through movement.
